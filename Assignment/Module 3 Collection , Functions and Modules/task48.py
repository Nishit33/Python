# How can you pick a random item from a list or tuple? 

import random

l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]          # list all number 

random_number  = random.choice(l)           # random number variable = random.choice(l)

print(random_number)                # print random number 



# Same as list and tuple random number select 


t = (99,77,66,55,44,88,33,22,44,11)             # tuple all number 

tuple_number = random.choice(t)                 # tuple number  =  random.choice(t)

print(tuple_number)                  # print tuple number
