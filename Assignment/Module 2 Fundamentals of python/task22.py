# What is the purpose continue statement in python? 

"""
The continue statement in Python is used within loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration immediately.

Here's a simple example :
for i in range(1, 11):
   		 if i == 5:
      			continue  
 	print(i)
