# When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?

"""
The else part of a try-except-else block is executed only if no exceptions are raised in the try block.

If the try block runs successfully without any exceptions, the code in the else block will be executed.
If an exception occurs in the try block, the else block is skipped, and the appropriate except block handles the error.
