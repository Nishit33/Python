#  What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed? 

"""
After executed we get output in boolean as False because "==" operator checks if both values are equal or not and here
given example "1" is string and another one is integer so python will consider them as unequal.
If example was 1==1 here we get True after execution because both values are equal.
