# Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python? 

"""
Exception Handling in Python:

Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur during the execution of a program. 
Instead of letting the program crash, Python allows you to "catch" the exception (error) and handle it gracefully,
either by logging the error, providing a fallback mechanism, or notifying the user.


Python uses try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle exceptions.

"""
What is an Error in Python?
An error in Python refers to a problem that prevents the program from executing properly. 

There are two main types of errors:

1 Syntax Errors:

These occur when the code does not follow Python's syntax rules.
Python detects syntax errors before running the code.


2 Exceptions (Runtime Errors):

These occur while the program is running. Even if the syntax is correct, something unexpected happens during execution that causes the error.
